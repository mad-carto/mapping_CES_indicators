## Repository Contents  

- **Notebooks (HTML and IPYNB)**  
  - `S1_GSM_Data_Processing&LanguageModelTraining.ipynb` / `.html`  
    Data preprocessing of geosocial media (GSM) textual metadata, including text normalization, language detection, and training of word embedding models.  

  - `S2_GSM_Data_TextClassification.ipynb` / `.html`  
    Unsupervised text classification workflow to detect GSM posts related to aesthetic appreciation and wildlife recreation. Includes similarity computation, thresholding, and validation metrics.  

  - `S3_Generate_ChiValueExpectationSurface.ipynb` / `.html`  
    Spatial analysis workflow for computing chi expectation surfaces and mapping over- and under-representation of cultural ecosystem service flows in urban green spaces.  

- **Environment file**  
  - `environment.yml` â€” contains all dependencies required to run the notebooks in a reproducible Python environment.

## How to Use  

### Option 1: View Only  
Open the `.html` versions of the notebooks directly in any web browser (no installation required).  

### Option 2: Reproduce the Workflow  
Clone this repository and open the Jupyter Notebooks in Jupyter Lab  
   ```bash
   conda env create -f nlp_environment.yml
   conda activate nlp_env
   jupyterlab
```
